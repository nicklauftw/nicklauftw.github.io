      <p>
        Hey, I'm a software designer in Chicago. Currently, I'm the Lead UI/UX Designer for Marquette Associates, a financial services & consulting firm, where I am building tools used by financial analysts and consultants. Prior to that, I was a UX Architect at Duckcreek Technologies designing software for insurance processes of claims, billing, and policy. As a UX generalist, I bridge design & code in the software development life cycle and users & business requirements with the augmentation of AI.
