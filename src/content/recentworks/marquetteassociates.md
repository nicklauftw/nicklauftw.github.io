  Lead UI/UX Designer for an internal tool used by financial analysts, advisors, and consultants for their day to day workflow.
---

At Marquette Associates, I led the design of a legacy WinForms app used internally by financial analysts, advisors, and consultants into a modern and intuitive web application. The goal was not just to port over an existing app with a prettier UI but to take the opportunity to improve the UX by designing workflows that are straight forward and logical from user feedback and research, thus reducing errors and increasing productivity. Tools used are Figma for rapid UI layout mockups, Blazor (HTML/CSS) templates for prototyping workflows and completed designs, and Excel for collecting user feedback and analysis.
