  Sole, therefore de facto lead, UI/UX Designer at Spirit Hub, a luxury e-commerce site for rare craft spirits from independent distilleries.
---

Spirit Hub is a luxury e-commerce site for rare craft spirits from independent distilleries across the country delivered to your door. As the sole UI/UX Designer, I crafted the experience of how the user lands on the site from various funnels, to browsing the catalog, to checkout payment and delivery scheduling, to repeat purchases. Beyond the typical e-commerce userflows is delivery scheduling that had to be received by an over 21 recipient by the deliverer and a novel reminder system was researched &amp; designed by me through the use of calendar events and smartphone notifications ensured successful deliveries and minimized returns to the warehouse.
