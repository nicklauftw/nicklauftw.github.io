  Front End Design & Development at Label Insight, data analytics for CPG.
---

My role as the Front End Designer/Developer on the product verification team, where the users are presented a grid view of their respective products in different states of the workflow. The workflow process is an individual product that is ready to have its data verified, in progress of verification, verified but needs data fields to be resolved and finally, verified and published.

Before being assigned to the product verification tool, I primarily led the HTML & CSS refactor of the redesign of the Label Insight app and built clickable prototypes of the product verification tool as it matured from an idea that needs to be validated to a full fledged product that could be sold to customers.
